# BergDiningApp

This Android App was created for CSI 210: Software Engineering. Our team of 3 envisioned, designed, and created this project 
in about 6 weeks.

More information on the functionality, design, and documentation can be found in the Wiki section of this repository.

Below is a link to some screenshots displaying what the final result looks like. If you have any questions or suggestions, please email jk249997@muhlenberg.edu
